2022-09-13: 2.1.7 (2aa3710):
- Improve resolution of duty cycle calculation.
	We now have a max current resolution of 1.25mA

- Add API that shows button-pressed duration during boot (for recovery purposes)
- Improve PWM initialization
- FIX bug in PP/PE voltage calculation
- Add proper implementation for CP connect/disconnect through API
	disconnect is only possible in IEC61851 state A or B
	IEC61851 state stays unaltered during disconnect phase

- Make sure contactor is not turned off under load, even if stop of charging is triggered by wallbox
- Add API for get/set boost modus
- Split control pilot API into set/get_control_pilot_disconnect and set/get_ev_wakeup
- Implement ev wakup (disconnect CP if EV does not wakeup by itself) according to IEC61851

- Set contactor check invalid counter in case of emergency contactor shutdown (dc error)
- Only set meter configuration once instead of continuously
- Transfer correct amount of meter values (last value was always 0)

2023-03-17: 2.1.11 (e10c4cd)
- Add max current input configuration support

2023-04-14: 2.1.12 (0b09849)
- Initialize meter values as NaN and return unkown meter until each value read once

2023-06-21: 2.1.13 (60baea0)
- Add blink led indicator code 2001-2010 for custom error code with 1-10 "blink amount"
- Add automatic DC fault test after each charging session and at least every 24h
- Make sure active cp disconnect can not be turned off again through API from external
- Make sure meter type is only reconfigured once per complete read of register set
- Add "time_since_dc_fault_check" parameter to "get_low_level_state" function
- Reset timeout counter when meter is found for the first time (through bricklib)

2023-08-21: 2.1.14 (61003a7)
- Don't check for DC fault when contactor is turned off
- Start immediate DC fault sensor re-calibration after dc fault reset (to go back to error state in case of a defective sensor)
- Fix read of stored startup value of boost mode
- Wait for at least 30 seconds until contactor is turned on again after state D
- Wait for at least 5 seconds until contactor is turned on again after charging was stopped

TBD: 2.2.0 (TBD)

- Add support for DSZ15DZMOD meter from Eltako (through bricklib2)
- Add support for DEM4A meter from YTL (through bricklib2)
- Add support for X804 6mA fault current detection
	This should now show 6mA error for X904 and X804 correctly
- Add additional debug information to dc fault state
	Note: Bits 0-2 are unchanged by this, but bits 3-5 are now used (were unused before)
- Add DC fault sensor type detection
