- Fix off-by-one in energy meter values

2021-10-06: 2.0.4 (cbd8171):
- Fix (theoretical) buffer overflow in modbus checksum calculation
- Add timeout in case of modbus errors
- Fix bug in "stop charging by button"-configuration that can lead to unstoppable charge state

2021-10-27: 2.0.5 (fe6960e):
- Add ChargeTime parameter to low level state getter
- Fix modbus endianess mixup
- Add GetButtonState API
- Add GetAllDataX API (for internal use in WARP Charger)

2021-12-03: 2.0.6 (4cc06fc):
- Add Control Pilot API
- Improve active/connected phase detection
- Improve vehicle connected detection in case of error on startup

2022-01-10: 2.0.7 (7ee5808):
- Increase active-phase-threshold to 300mA

2022-01-26: 2.1.0 (7fbda68):
- Add support for charging slots and corresponding API

2022-02-22: 2.1.1 (0f880d2):
- Improve all data API segmentation
- Assume that the managed mode is configured in slot 7 and apply the legacy configuration to it

2022-03-28: 2.1.2 (4570a92):
- Use slots for shutdown input

2022-05-02: 2.1.3 (16a7ac4):
- Add FactoryReset-function
- Add support for SDM72V2

2022-05-06: 2.1.4 (bdeb88e):
- Improve button start/stop logic

2022-06-07: 2.1.5 (43252c9):
- Make sure to never start charging when button is pressed
- During energy meter detection use SDM630 as default

2022-06-09: 2.1.6 (35332da):
- Fix bug with meter type detection for WARP2 Charger Smart (bug was introduced in 2.1.5)

2022-09-13: 2.1.7 (2aa3710):
- Improve resolution of duty cycle calculation.
	We now have a max current resolution of 1.25mA
- Make sure cp/pe and pp/pe resistances are properly initialized
	We don't want to be in error state for the fist 1ms after boot
- Add minimum time of 30s between error state E/F and next activation of contactor
- Add API that shows button-pressed duration during boot (for recovery purposes)
- Improve PWM initialization
- FIX bug in PP/PE voltage calculation
- Add proper implementation for CP connect/disconnect through API
	disconnect is only possible in IEC61851 state A or B
	IEC61851 state stays unaltered during disconnect phase

2022-11-16: 2.1.8 (1bab43c):
- Make sure that control pilot disconnect does not zero user slot on accident
- Make input, output and button configuration persistent
- Add additional master communication watchdog

202X-XX-XX: 2.1.9 (TBD):
- Make sure contactor is not turned off under load, even if stop of charging is triggered by wallbox
