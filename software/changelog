- Add support for charging slots and corresponding API

2022-02-22: 2.1.1 (0f880d2):
- Improve all data API segmentation

- Improve button start/stop logic

2022-06-07: 2.1.5 (43252c9):
- Make sure to never start charging when button is pressed
- During energy meter detection use SDM630 as default

2022-06-09: 2.1.6 (35332da):
- Fix bug with meter type detection for WARP2 Charger Smart (bug was introduced in 2.1.5)

2022-09-13: 2.1.7 (2aa3710):
- Improve resolution of duty cycle calculation.
	We now have a max current resolution of 1.25mA
- Make sure cp/pe and pp/pe resistances are properly initialized
	We don't want to be in error state for the fist 1ms after boot
- Add minimum time of 30s between error state E/F and next activation of contactor
- Add API that shows button-pressed duration during boot (for recovery purposes)
- Improve PWM initialization
- FIX bug in PP/PE voltage calculation
- Add proper implementation for CP connect/disconnect through API
	disconnect is only possible in IEC61851 state A or B
	IEC61851 state stays unaltered during disconnect phase

2022-11-16: 2.1.8 (1bab43c):
- Make sure that control pilot disconnect does not zero user slot on accident

- Add additional master communication watchdog

2022-12-22: 2.1.9 (2907d39):
- Make sure contactor is not turned off under load, even if stop of charging is triggered by wallbox
- Add API for get/set boost modus
- Split control pilot API into set/get_control_pilot_disconnect and set/get_ev_wakeup
- Implement ev wakup (disconnect CP if EV does not wakeup by itself) according to IEC61851

2023-02-24: 2.1.10 (1a1c81f)
- Set contactor check invalid counter in case of emergency contactor shutdown (dc error)
- Only set meter configuration once instead of continuously
- Transfer correct amount of meter values (last value was always 0)

2023-03-17: 2.1.11 (e10c4cd)
- Add max current input configuration support

2023-04-14: 2.1.12 (0b09849)
- Initialize meter values as NaN and return unkown meter until each value read once

2023-06-21: 2.1.13 (60baea0)
- Add blink led indicator code 2001-2010 for custom error code with 1-10 "blink amount"
- Add automatic DC fault test after each charging session and at least every 24h
- Make sure active cp disconnect can not be turned off again through API from external
- Make sure meter type is only reconfigured once per complete read of register set
- Add "time_since_dc_fault_check" parameter to "get_low_level_state" function
- Reset timeout counter when meter is found for the first time (through bricklib)
